Webhook branch contains simple http daemon, which can process webhook requests from github

It is possible to emulate webhook request by:

curl -v \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"repository": {"full_name": "enp/tent"}, "ref": "refs/heads/application", "head_commit": {"id": "e78a"}}' \
    -X POST http://127.0.0.1:18202
